### Hi there, Heitorado here ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Ruby Backend Developer at @VTEX
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby, Rails and a lot about Software Engineering and how to write good, modular and clean code. I believe I'll keep learning new things about those topics every day through my carreer.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on social impact projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with front end development! Currently trying to set a path to start learning, I just know the very basics.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - C
  - Ruby / Rails
  - Docker / Docker compose
  - Intermediate Linux and Bash
  - How my day was
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: My @ at Telegram is the same as my Github user :)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, but honestly I'm comfortable with any
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like making custom keyboards and sometimes I do my daily work reports using garden analogies.
