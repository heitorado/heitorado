### Hi there, Heitorado here 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a TypeScript developer at @VTEX
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, React, CSS and fiddling with the Testing Framework/Cypress. On a more general/broad perspective, I'm exploring a lot about Software Engineering and how to write good, modular and clean code; as well as how to build performatic websites. I believe I'll keep learning new things about those topics every day through my carreer.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on social impact projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with front end development! Currently trying to set a path to start learning, I just know the very basics.
- 💬 Ask me about:
  - C
  - Ruby / Rails
  - Docker / Docker compose
  - Intermediate Linux and Bash
  - How my day was
- 📫 How to reach me: My @ at Telegram is the same as my Github user :)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, but honestly I'm comfortable with any
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like making custom keyboards and sometimes I do my daily work reports using garden analogies.
