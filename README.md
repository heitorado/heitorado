### Hi there, Heitorado here.

Currently working at [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) with Ruby, Python and LLMs.
Also a Master's student at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, studying Software Engineering and Programming Languages.
Always eager to learn more about cloud services, AI, and a bit of functional programming here and there.
Also a wannabe-Rustacean.

I enjoy crafting custom keyboards, tech gadgets, coffee and beer.

Some of my interests, but naturally not all:
  - CrewAI Lib, LLMs in general
  - Ruby / Rails
  - Python / Django
  - Docker, Linux and Bash
  - Rust and other interesting programming languages
  - Music, Movies, Games, Plants and Recipes
