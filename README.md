### Hi there, Heitorado here.

Currently working at [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) with Ruby, Python, AWS, AI Agents and LLMs.<br>
Master's student at [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/), studying Software Engineering and Programming Languages.

Always eager to learn more about cloud services, AI, and a bit of functional programming here and there.<br>
Also a wannabe-Rustacean.


I enjoy crafting custom keyboards, tech gadgets, coffee and beer.


- Some of my interests, but naturally not all of them:
  - CrewAI Lib, LLMs in general
  - Ruby / Rails
  - Python / Django
  - Docker, Linux and Bash
  - Rust and other interesting programming languages
  - Music, Movies, Games, Plants and Recipes
